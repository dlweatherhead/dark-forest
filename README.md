# Dark Forest 
This is my Global Game Jam 2016 entry.

I wanted to experiment with Unity's terrain tools and a model with animations. I also wanted to try and create something with a creepy, atmospheric horror feel.

## Description
You are a wanderer that has been trapped in a dark forest with the task of helping a disembodied Nephalem Flame find and recover the rest of his Nephalem flames in the forest. Beware though, as evil guards the Nephalem flames with possessed Dark Priests.
The game is meant to be played dark with low contrast and earphones.
I hope you enjoy.
